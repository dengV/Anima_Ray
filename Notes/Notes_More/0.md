> When you find the correct constraint, you adjust constant to 100 pt to push the title to the left when the menu opens.


### Note: There’s slightly easier way to dynamically find an existing constraint and work with it; you’ll look into that next.

### Animating by replacing constraints
At this point in the chapter, you’ve only modified the constant property of your constraints. Ironically, the constant property is a mutable property in the NSLayoutConstraint class!
If you want to modify the multiplier, or change a constraint in any other way, you’ll need to remove the constraint then add a new one in its place.

### This time around, you’ll use a different technique to make sure you’ve got the correct constraint.
In Interface Builder you can assign an identifier to each constraint, which can help you easily get hold of it at run time.
