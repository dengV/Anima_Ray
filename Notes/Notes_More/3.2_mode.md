The fillMode property lets you control the behavior of your animation at the beginning and end of its sequence.


The constant kCAFillModeRemoved is the default value of fillMode. This starts the animation at the defined beginTime — or instantly, if you haven’t set beginTime — and removes the changes made during the animation when the animation completes:

kCAFillModeForwards plays the animation as usual, but retains the final frame of the animation on the screen until you remove the animation:


动画， 把 视图， 移到 哪里， 就算哪里了。

In addition to setting kCAFillModeForwards, you’ll need to make some other changes to the layer to get the last frame to “stick”. You’ll learn about this a little later in the chapter.

## kCAFillModeBoth

kCAFillModeBoth is a combination of kCAFillModeForwards and kCAFillModeBackwards;
as you’d expect, this makes the first frame of the animation appear on the screen immediately and retains the final frame on the screen when the animation is finished:
