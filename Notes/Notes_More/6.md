## Grouping animations


<hr>


In the previous chapter you learned how to add multiple, independent animations to a single layer. But what if you want your animations to work synchronously and stay in step with each other? It’s no fun having to fiddle with the math and timings of all the animations separately. That’s where animation groups come in.

> This chapter shows you how to group animations using CAAnimationGroup, which lets you add several animations to a group and adjust properties such as duration, delegate, and timingFunction all at once.

Grouping animations results in simplified code, and ensures that all your animations will synchronize as one, solid unit.

### CAAnimationGroup


This code creates a new animation group for your use. CAAnimationGroup inherits from CAAnimation, so you can work with the same properties you already know and love such as beginTime, duration, fillMode, delegate, and isRemovedOnCompletion.


You’ll add one final animation to the login button to scale, rotate, and fade it in with the end effect that the button falls neatly into place on the screen.


Add the first animation by adding the following code directly below the group animation code you just added:
