Before you rush through and blindly copy and paste the code to create a CABasicAnimation for the username field, consider the following two facts:



> • A CABasicAnimation object is just a data model, which is not bound to any particular
layer.

> • add(_:forKey:) makes a copy of the animation object.


It turns out that you can simply take the animation from your heading layer, adjust the animation a bit if needed and reuse it to animate your username field onto the screen.
Add the following code in the same spot where you deleted the code above in viewWillAppear():


> username.layer.add(flyRight, forKey: nil)



<hr>


<hr>


<hr>


Add the following line just before the line where you add the flyRight animation to your username layer:


> flyRight.beginTime = CACurrentMediaTime() + 0.3


The beginTime property of your animation sets the absolute time the animation should start; in this case you get the current time with CACurrentMediaTime() and add to it the desired delay in seconds.


Build and run your app again to see how things look; it appears in the center of the screen, as it was designed in Interface Builder, and starts animating 0.3 seconds later. What gives?


## 我日蚜， 果然有 bug.  那哥们 username 视图， 首先 在 center , 到点了， 0.3 秒，又消失 从右到左。
